这应该是一篇被广泛转载的东西了吧，我也转帖上来吧。


松本行弘（Yukihiro Matsumoto）是Ruby语言的发明者。



* Learn more than one programming languages , preferably many different syle ones , like scripting ,object-oriented ,functional , logic ,etc. Learning languages teaches you many about programming.

*  Read good books , for example , "Pragmatic Programmers" ,"Refactoring",and "Art of Computer Science".

*  Read the source code.The source code is the source of information and knowledge.Thanks to the opensource.

*  Don't focus too much on tools.Tools changes.Algorithms and basic fundamentals do not.

*  Don't focus too much on machines.Programmers often fall in the computer's vies point.But human make programs,program serve human.Don't forget that programming is a human oriented activity.

*  Be lazy.Machines should serve human being.Often programmers serve machines unconsciously.Let machines serve you.Do everything you can to make you lazy.

*  Test early,test often.Write test suites before you code,if possible.

*  Be nice to others.Consider interface first,man to man ,man to machine,and machine to machine.Again,human factor is import.

*  Be creative.

*  Enjoying programming and life .I believe that is one of the purpose of life.
